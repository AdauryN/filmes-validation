## Description

**FilmesValidation** is a movie website that uses the IMDB API to offer an interactive platform where users can:

- Write movie reviews
- Rate movies
- Create custom movie lists
- Organize watchparties for group viewing

The goal of the project is to provide a fun and easy-to-use tool for movie lovers, allowing them to share their opinions and organize events to watch their favorite films with friends.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can sign up and log in to access the site's features.
- **Movie Reviews**: Users can write and read reviews for films, in which their friends are able to see and react.
- **Movie Ratings**: Users can give movies a rating from 1 to 5 stars based on their personal preferences.
- **Custom Movie Lists**: Users can create custom lists such as "Best Action Movies", "Favorites of 2024", and more.
- **Watchparties**: Users can organize watchparties where they notify their friends to watch movies together, either online or offline.

## How It Works

1. **IMDB Integration**: The site uses the public IMDB API to fetch data about movies, including synopses, cast information, ratings, and more.
2. **Reviews and Ratings**: Logged-in users can post reviews and rate films, which are displayed on each movie's page.
3. **Movie Lists**: Users can create and share movie lists, which can be set as public or private.
4. **Watchparties**: Users can create events, invite other participants, and watch movies together in real-time, with live chat functionality to interact during the session.
